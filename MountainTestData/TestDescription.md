#Mountain Test

For this test we tested to see if we could get data transmitting from the top of Mount Wachusett to the bottom. To do this we set up the base station antenna at the bottom of the Mountian and started the payload code. Then a team took the payload to the summit waited until the base station got data. The payload was then hiked down.
